Come on, come on, come on
Let's go        		
Vacation, need a little sun          
I'm going to get my friends together and have a little fun          
Ain't nobody going to tell us what we going to do         
Because today it's up to me and you          
Temptation calling out to me         
A little relaxation I'll be free to be          
Come on and wicky wicky lou          
I do believe it'll start now           
Kick it back to the track          
Vacation's where I want to be           
Buddy on the beach where the fun is free           
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate           
Repeat after me: I need a vacation            
Let's go          
Vacation's where I want to be          
Buddy on the beach where the fun is free          
We don't need a holiday to start to celebrate          
Because I need a break, I need a vacation           
Vacation's where I want to be        
Buddy on the beach where the fun is free
