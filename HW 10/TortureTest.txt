The Cars franchise is cool and all but imagine if they had a crossover
Like in Cars2 they have the Toy Story people join and have the buggy
The buggy could be like Cars25 and the toys all race and stuff
Its quite interesting to consider
Also, Cars Cars2 Cars2 Cars3 Cars3 Cars2 Cars2 Cars3 Cars3 and Cars3 are about cars
